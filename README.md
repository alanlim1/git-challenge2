Hello all! ;)


Itâ€™s Friday, 29th July.

    Challenge time: Friday, the entire day.
    Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own.
    If you have a partial solution, still check in a partial solution.


So, your challenge today:

    Write a simple program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
    But, instead of the numbers, the program will print:
        'Ola' for any number divisible by three;
        'Bola' for any number divisible by five;
        'OlaBola' for any number divisible by three and five; and
        Otherwise, return the number.


To play the program, run this code in the console, and it should print the expected outcomes.



Make sure you complete the challenge, commit and push to Github, and email us the link to your solution repo.

Have fun.
